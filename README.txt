UberAutoBooker
==============
This is a minimal Android Studio project to demonstrate scheduling and automating an Uber booking using deeplinks + AccessibilityService.
IMPORTANT: This is for personal/testing use only. Do NOT publish to Play Store without compliance.

How to open:
1. Copy this folder into your machine or download the ZIP from the downloaded package.
2. Open Android Studio -> Open -> select the folder containing settings.gradle
3. Let Gradle sync. You may need to install a compatible Gradle version.

Notes:
- You must manually enable the Accessibility Service in Settings -> Accessibility -> Uber Auto Booker
- Test carefully with a non-critical booking first.
